on the provided experiment parameters and results, we can observe the following trends:\n","\n","1. **Effect of Population Size and Mutation Scale:** \n","   - In the first experiment with `num_generations=5`, `population_size=10`, and `mutation_scale=0.05`, the average accuracy achieved was `0.816`.\n","   - In the second experiment with `num_generations=15`, `population_size=20`, and `mutation_scale=0.15`, the average accuracy decreased to `0.755`.\n","   - In the third experiment with `num_generations=50`, `population_size=20`, and `mutation_scale=0.2`, the average accuracy further decreased to `0.714`.\n","   - The decrease in accuracy with larger mutation scales and population sizes suggests that overly large mutations and populations can lead to suboptimal solutions. \n","\n","2. **Impact of Number of Generations:** \n","   - Increasing the number of generations from 5 to 15 resulted in a slight decrease in accuracy.\n","   - However, increasing the number of generations to 50 did not lead to a significant improvement in accuracy.\n","   - This suggests that after a certain number of generations, the algorithm may reach a plateau in performance, and further iterations may not lead to substantial improvements.\n","\n","3. **Effect of k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):** \n","   - The k-NN parameter also plays a role in the accuracy of the algorithm.\n","   - The first experiment used `knn_neighbors=3`, which resulted in the highest accuracy among the three experiments.\n","   - The second and third experiments used larger values of `knn_neighbors`, which might have contributed to the lower accuracies observed.\n","\n","In conclusion, the experiment results indicate that smaller population sizes, lower mutation scales, and moderate values of `knn_neighbors` (around 3) tend to lead to higher accuracy in this scenario. Additionally, there seems to be a point of diminishing returns with increasing the number of generations, suggesting the importance of finding a balance between the number of generations and other parameters for optimal results."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d0811e36","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.009777,"end_time":"2024-04-18T13:12:35.897143","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-04-18T13:12:35.887366","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["**********************************************\n","**Genrally,
